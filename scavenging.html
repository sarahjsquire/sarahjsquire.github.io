            <h2>Scavenging for Sustenance with Sarah Squire: Sept. 30, 2010</h2>
            <p>Hi, my name is Sarah Squire and I&#x27;m the co-managing design editor at the Daily. I spend many nights at 420 Maynard, beginning at 6:00 pm and going well into the morning. Unlike most staffers I rarely venture outside the building for dinner, instead I scavenge — I observe, plot, ask, beg, and occasionally barter to scrounge together a full meal by the end of the night. This is my latest victory:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>1 slice of pizza found in the Daily</li>
                <li>1/2 serving of french fries from Sava&#x27;s</li>
                <li>1/4 vegetarian burrito from Chipotle</li>
                <li>1 word of gummy letters</li>
            </ul>
          
            <p><em>*All measurements are approximate</em></p>
          
            <p><strong>AND A TIP:</strong> Carry your own utensils. Brandishing a fork demonstrates your conviction and gives you an edge over nearby scavengers.</p>

            <p>Hi, my name is Sarah Squire and I&#x27;m the co-managing design editor at the Daily. I spend many nights at 420 Maynard, beginning at 6 p.m. and going well into the morning. Unlike most staffers I rarely venture outside the building for dinner, instead I scavenge — I observe, plot, ask, beg, and occasionally barter to scrounge together a full meal by the end of the night. This is my latest victory:</p>

                <li>1 potato chip from Cosi</li>
                <li>2 solo cups of apple cider</li>
                <li>1/2 a panda bowl (mostly fried rice) from Panda Express</li>
                <li>1/6 order of Cheddar Ale fries from Ashley&#x27;s</li>

            <h2>Scavenging for Sustenance with Sarah Squire: Nov. 18, 2010</h2>
            <p>Hi, my name is Sarah Squire and I&#x27;m the co-managing design editor at the Daily. I spend many nights at 420 Maynard, beginning at 6 p.m. and going well into the morning. Unlike most staffers I rarely venture outside the building for dinner, instead I scavenge — I observe, plot, ask, beg, and occasionally barter to scrounge together a full meal by the end of the night. This is my latest victory:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>1 chocolate tortilla chip</li>
                <li>1/2 a bag of chips from Chipotle</li>
                <li>2 containers of salsa from Tio&#x27;s</li>
                <li>Leftover chips and bean dip from Tio&#x27;s</li>
                <li>15 Premium saltines</li>
                <li>1/2 a turkey wrap saved from Tuesday&#x27;s scavenge</li>
            </ul>
          
            <p><em>*All measurements are approximate</em></p>
          
            <p><strong>AND A TIP:</strong> Not all food items are meant to be eaten alone. But if you find yourself with salsa don&#x27;t give up, go find some chips to go with it.</p>

This is my latest victory:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>3 bites of a hamburger from a bar in Ypsilanti</li>
                <li>6 sweet potato fries from a bar in Ypsilanti</li>
                <li>1 large onion ring from a bar in Ypsilanti</li>
                <li>6 Chanukah gelt coins</li>
                <li>3 medium boneless wings from Buffalo Wild Wings</li>

            <p><strong>AND A TIP:</strong> Sad that Thanksgiving is behind you? Eager to scavenge some junk food for your all night study sessions? Well look no further! The best part about study groups are the snacks. Not that anyone is buying for the group, but your study mates are likely to splurge on something incredibly unhealthy, and when they realize 1/5 of the way in that they definitely do not want to eat anymore, you&#x27;ll be ready to swoop in and finish it off. Just avoid locations where food is prohibited.</p>
