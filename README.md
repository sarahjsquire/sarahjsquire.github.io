My old personal website and portfolio I built in 2011.


## Install

If you don't have it already, you'll need to install node and npm.
If you don't have global gulp, run `npm install --global gulp-cli`

Otherwise:

```npm install```

## Build

Watch sass and templates and use browsersync:

```gulp watch```
